// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  


// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!

var firstNumber = prompt("first number");
var secondNumber = prompt("2nd number");
var sum = Number(firstNumber) + Number(secondNumber);
var diff = Number(firstNumber) - Number(secondNumber);
var multiply = Number(firstNumber) * Number(secondNumber);
var divide = Number(firstNumber) / Number(secondNumber);
alert("The sum is: " + sum + ". The difference is: " + diff + ". The multiplication is: " + multiply + ". The division is: " + divide);
